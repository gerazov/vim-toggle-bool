# vim-toggle-bool

This is a very simple Vim plugin built on top of [switch.vim](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/switch.vim) that can be used to toggle various boolean values. The following toggles are made: 
- `True` ←→ `False`
- `Yes` ←→ `No`
- `On` ←→ `Off`
- `1` ←→ `0`
- `Enable(d)` ←→ `Disable(d)`
- `First` ←→ `Last`
- `Before` ←→ `After`
- `Persistent` ←→ `Ephemeral`
- `Ingress` ←→ `Egress`

The toggle works for the first match on the current line and does not change the cursor position. Upper, lower and capitalised case are supported and retained.

## Install

Install can be done via a plugin manager. Additionally [switch.vim](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/switch.vim) needs to be installed as well.

For [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) it's:

```vim
Plug 'AndrewRadev/switch.vim'
Plug 'gerazov/vim-toggle-bool'
```

## Usage

The plugin creates a single command `ToggleBool`. An example keymapping is:

```vim
nnoremap <silent> <Leader>s :ToggleBool<CR>
```

## Requirements 

Toggling is done via [switch.vim](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/switch.vim) and is needed to be installed.
